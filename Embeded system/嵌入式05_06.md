只有加了s的指令才会在执行后重置flags，否则不会
CPI clock per instruction
ARM里的数据总线被用来取指令和存取数据，存取数据的时候就不能取指令

## Interrupts
An interrupt is triggered when the microprocessor
receives a (voltage) signal on a sp0ecial connection
within the control bus.
+ Two types of interrupts in ARM7
+ IRQ(normal interrupt)
+ FIQ(fast interrupt)
+ what happened when the microprocessor receives an interrupt signal?
    + switch mode (user mode/FIQ mode/IRQ mode)
    + each mode has it's own link register and stack pointer
    + CPSR current program status register
    + SPSR saved program status register
    + Interrupt Vectors 
    + FIQ比IRQ优先级更高
    + FIQ有自己的r8-r12，所以中断发生时不用入栈r8-r12
## Pipeline
here based on 3 stage instruction pipeline in ARM 
+ CPU cycles: fetch, decode, execute
    + deocde:Thumb to arm decompression, decode, resigter selection
    + execute: register read, barrel shift, ALU operation, register write
+ branch instruction
    branch instruction will reload program counter so two cycles are lost
    + in 6 clock cycles only four instructions are executed-1.5cpi
    + link register is updated during the two clock cyles when no instruction is being executed
+ interrupts
    + minimum latency for FIQ: 4
    + minimum latency for IRQ: 7
    + FIQ can be interrupted by a system reset
+ Load and store instructions
    occupied data bus so data bus cannot be used to fetch an instruction at that time.
    + harvard architecture: two bus one for data other for instructions. eliminating conflicts
    + von Neumann architecture: one data bus for both
## The procedure for CPU
+ A bus, B bus, ALU bus
    only B bus can do barrel shift
+ ALU is not used to increment program counter and address register
+ rotate left by x bits is equivalent to rotatee right by 32-x bits
+ **Load example**
    3 clock cycles
+ **Store example**
    2 clock cycles
## cycles saving
+ Why provide autoindexing
+ LDM(load multiple)
+ STM(store multiple)
