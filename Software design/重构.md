Refactoring
===========
## code smell
### Duplicated Code
#### examples
same expression in two methods in the same class
same expression in two methods in sibling classes
same expression in two unrelated classes
extract method, extract class
template method pattern, strategy pattern
### Style Smells
- comments
Copious comments can be indicative of bad code
- naming
rules of making names
- dead code
delete it. use version control
### Long Method
small methods can help explain code and easier to maintain
**extract method**
### Large Class
too many instance variables
**extract method** **extract subclass** **observers**
### Long Parameter List
**replace parameter with method** **introduce parameter object** **preserve whole object**
### Divergent Change
commonly change a particular class in different ways of different reasons
**extract class**
### Shotgun Surgery
one change alters many classes, constantly making lots of little changes to a lot of different classes
**move method** **move field** **inline class**
### Feature Envy
a class repeatedly calls getter and seter methods on some other class
**extract method** **move method** **move field**
### Data Clumps
bunches of data that hang aroung together should be made into their own object
**extract class** **preserve whole object** **introduce parameter object**

### Primitive Obsession
reluctant to use small objects for money, strings, intervals
**replace data values with object** **replace type code with class** **replace type code with state/strategy**
### Switch Statements
**replace conditional with polymorphism**
### Lazy Class
**collapse hierarchy** **inline class**
### Speculative Generality
**collapse hierarchy** **rename method** **inline class** **remove parameter**
### Temporary Field
**exract class** **introduce null object**
### Message Chains
a long line of method calls or temporary variables to get some data
getThis().getThat().getSomthing()
**hide delegate** **extract method** **move method**
### Middle Man
sometimes, we end up with a design that all an object is doing is passing along class to another object
**remove middle man** **inline method** **replace delegation** **with inheritance**
### Inappropriate Intimacy
classes sometimes end up delving too much into each other's private methods and fields
### Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
classes can be completely different on the outside but end up being the same internally
**extract superclass** **unify interfaces with adapter**
### Refused Bequest
you inherit code you don't want
**push down field** **push down method** **replace inheritance with delegation**

----------------------
## refactorings
### Extract Method
change repeated fragment into a method
### Extract Class
you have one class doing work that should be done by two different classes
### Template Method Pattern
??
### Replace Parameter with Method
an object invokes a method then passes the result as a parameter for a method
let receiver invoke the method
### Introduce Parameter Object
replace a group of parameters with a single object
### Preserve Whole Object
pass the whole object as parameter rather than each variable in that object
### Move Method
a method would be used by other class other than the class within which it is defined 
### Replace Data Value with Object
turn data item into an object
### Replace Type Code with Class
replace the number with a new class
### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism 
!!!! 理解代码
### Collapse Hierarchy
### Inline Class
### Introduce Null Object
replace the null value with a null object
### Hide Delegate
create methods on the server to hide the delegate
```java
manager = john.getDepartment().getManager();
//change this to:
public Peron getManager(){
    return _department.getManager();
}
```
### Remove Middleman
get the client to call the delegate directly
this is the exact dual for **hide delegate**
### Inline Method
put the method's body into the body of its callers and remove the method
### Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional
one class no longer needs access to the other
drop the unneeded end of the association
### Encapsulate Collection
make it return a read-only view and provide add/remove methods
### Repalce Inheritance with delegation
create a field for the superclass, adjust methods to delegate to the superclass, and remove the subclassing
