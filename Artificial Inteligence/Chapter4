4.1 Local Search Algorithms and Optimization Problems
---------------------------------
---------------------------------
### 4.1.1 Hill-climbing search
continually moves in the direction of increasing value.
typically choose randomly among the set of best successors if there is more than one.
+ steepest-ascent
+ greedy local search
+ hill climbing often gets stuck for the following reasons:
    + **Local maxima**:
    + **Ridges**:
    + **Plateaux**:
+ sideways move
+ variants
    + **stochastic hill climbing**
    + **first-choice hill climbing**
    + **random-restart hill climbing**
### 4.1.2 Simulated annealing
+ A hill-climbing algorithm that never makes "downhill" is guaranteed to be incomplete
+ accepts the movve with some probability less than 1
    + the probability decreases exponentially with the badness of the move
    + the probability also decreases as the temperature T goes down
### 4.1.3 Local beam search
keeps track of *k* states rather than just one
+ *In a local beam search, useful information is passed among the paralled search threads.*
+ stochastic beam seaerch: choose *k* successors at random
### 4.1.4 Genetic algorithms
+ fitness function
+ crossover
+ mutation
